# Leetcode Python Solutions.

## üìú Summary

This repository contains solutions to Leetcode problems. It will be updated regularly(Daily/Weekly). The primary reason for this repository is because I believe the best way to solve these problems is by dividing them into topics, each topic into difficulties, and solving at least one problem within each difficulty(quality > quantity). Such repositories are hard to find on the internet; this is the first one most likely. Therefore, I will gradually build this place to make it easier for beginners to learn algorithms by solving problems on leetcode by topics.

## Prerequisites

Basic understanding of the core language. If you are new to python, I highly recommend checking out the free learning material I compiled in the [`awesome-python`](https://github.com/Harmouch101/awesome-python) repository.

```sh
python -c "import this" | grep simple
```

```sh
Simple is better than complex.
```
